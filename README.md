# Hitchhikers-blackjack
A unique variant of Blackjack. This was originally made as a software project for my Year 11 Software Design and Development class. The main changes are as follows:

Players have to get to 42 instead of 21 (hence the name).

There are 8 suits instead of 4.

There are 21 unique cards instead of 13.

There are 10 decks instead of 1.

To get this to work, move all .java files into the "src" folder.

Requires user compilation

To do:

  Add counter to deck to track current card position

  Add subroutine to shuffle deck after ~80 percent of the deck has been used
  
  Add GUI (lots of work involved);
  Work involved with GUI:

    Create vector assets for cards

    Create cards
